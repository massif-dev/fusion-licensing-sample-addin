# Massif Licensing Tools for Python addins for Autodesk Fusion 360

A simple addin sample for Autodesk Fusion 360, that demonstrates the use of the Massif Licensing SDK for Python, to restrict the use of assets hosted on the **Massif Licensing Platform** to users that have valid licenses or subscriptions to use the asset/s.
Please note that this SDK should not be used for publishing your addins. To publish your apps on the store, we need to run them through our build process which secures your code. Once you have your
addin running and tested, you can submit it to Massif to have it secured, and published on the platform.
